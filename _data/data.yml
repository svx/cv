  title: About Me
  summary: |
    Being involved into various open-source projects, I developed a strong passion for documentation and developer experience (DX).<br/>
    For me (technical) documentation is more than "just" explaining how things are working.<br/>
    Good documentation is part of a great developer and user experience.<br/>
    <br/>
    Let's put the fun back into reading documentation and create the best DX possible for more efficiently and happiness!
